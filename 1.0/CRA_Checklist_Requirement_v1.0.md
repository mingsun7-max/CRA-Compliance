OpenChain CRA Compliance page: [https://cra-compliance.openchainproject.org](https://cra-compliance.openchainproject.org)

This document was developed as an open initiative with feedback received from OpenChain contributors. 
See [Annex D](#annex-d---additional-project-information) for further information.

Completing or signing this checklist does not in itself constitute a CRA conformity assessment, an EU Declaration of Conformity, or evidence of lawful CE marking. This document is a readiness and evidence-management tool supporting the applicable conformity-assessment procedure. This document does not constitute legal advice; consult qualified legal counsel before formal regulatory submission.

Important: All bracketed \[INSERT ...\] fields throughout this document must be completed with organization-specific information before any compliance claim or self-certification is made.


# **Section 1: Introduction & Scope**

CRA applicability is not determined solely by whether an organization deploys open-source software in the EU. The primary scope question is whether the organization makes a product with digital elements available on the Union market, or otherwise has a role covered by the CRA, such as manufacturer, importer, distributor, authorised representative, or open-source software steward.

If an organization does not make products with digital elements available on the Union market and does not have a covered CRA role, the requirements addressed by this checklist may not apply to that organization. Such organizations may still use it as a voluntary reference for understanding SBOMs, vulnerability handling, evidence management, and software supply chain readiness.

The OpenChain CRA Compliance Requirements & Checklist is a community-maintained, OpenChain-aligned self-certification and readiness resource for organizations preparing for EU Cyber Resilience Act obligations. It is mapped to Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 and aligned with ISO/IEC 18974, ISO/IEC 5230, and relevant SBOM guidance including BSI TR-03183. It covers governance, product assessment, SBOM quality, vulnerability handling, regulatory reporting, OSS stewardship, technical-file evidence, security updates, and supply-chain obligations.

The CRA (Regulation (EU) 2024/2847) establishes mandatory cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements (PDEs) placed on the EU market. The following role definitions are drawn from CRA Art. 3:

 

**Role definitions (CRA Art. 3):**

●  Manufacturer (Art. 3(13)): a natural or legal person who develops or manufactures a PDE, or has a PDE designed or manufactured, and markets it under their name or trademark, whether for payment, free of charge, or as a monetary revenue-generating service.

●  Importer (Art. 3(16)): a natural or legal person established in the Union who places on the market a PDE bearing the name or trademark of a natural or legal person established outside the Union.

●  Distributor (Art. 3(17)): a natural or legal person in the supply chain, other than the manufacturer or importer, that makes a PDE available on the Union market.

●  OSS Steward (Art. 3(14)): a legal person, other than a manufacturer, who provides support on a sustained basis for the development of products qualifying as FOSS and ensures the viability of those products. The definition, scope, and obligations of OSS Stewards are established in CRA Art. 3(14), Recitals 18 and 19, and Art. 24\.

 

**Scope of this document:**

●  All software products with digital elements placed on the EU market by \[INSERT: Full legal entity name of manufacturer\]

●  Open-source components included in released products

●  Software supply chain processes including SBOM generation, vulnerability management, and disclosure

●  Personnel and processes involved in development, security operations, legal, and compliance

 

Hardware scope note: Hardware-specific requirements (including §3.1.7 Hardware Bill of Materials) apply only to products containing physical hardware components. Software-only organizations may mark hardware-specific items N/A with documented rationale.

 

**Applicability by Organizational Role**

The CRA creates distinct obligations for different organizational roles. Determine which role(s) apply before completing this checklist. A single organization may occupy multiple roles simultaneously. Complete all sections that apply to each role held.

 

| Section | Manufacturer | Importer | Distributor | OSS Steward | Both Mfr+Steward | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **§2.1-2.4 Governance** | Required | Required | Required | Recommended | Required | All roles need basic governance |
| **§2.5-2.7 Product Assessment** | Required | Verify evidence / Art. 21 if applicable | Verify evidence / Art. 21 if applicable | N/A | Required | Importers/distributors verify manufacturer conformity evidence unless Article 21 makes them manufacturers; stewards are not manufacturers, so conformity assessment does not apply. |
| **§3.1-3.4 SBOM & SDLC** | Required | N/A | N/A | N/A | Required | Manufacturer builds the product |
| **§3.5 Importer/Distributor** | N/A | Required | Required | See note\* | N/A | \*Art. 24 may bring stewards into scope depending on activities |
| **§3.6 Third-Party Software Qualification** | Required | Verify evidence / Art. 21 if applicable | Verify evidence / Art. 21 if applicable | Recommended | Required | Manufacturer qualifies third-party software sources beyond OSS; importers/distributors verify evidence unless Article 21 makes them manufacturers |
| **§4 Vuln Handling** | Required | Inform manufacturer; Art. 21 if applicable | Inform manufacturer; Art. 21 if applicable | Partial (see note\*\*) | Required | Importers/distributors must inform the manufacturer without undue delay when they become aware of vulnerabilities; Articles 13/14 apply directly if Article 21 makes them manufacturers. Art. 14(1) applies where steward is involved in development; Art. 14(3) and 14(8) apply where severe incidents affect network/information systems provided by the steward |
| **§5 OSS Stewardship** | Optional | Optional | Optional | Required | Required | Core for steward role |
| **§6 Support Period** | Required | N/A | N/A | N/A | Required | Manufacturer sets support period |
| **§7.1-7.4 Technical File** | Required | Verify only | Verify only | N/A | Required | Importers check, not produce |
| **§8 Cross-Framework** | As applicable | As applicable | As applicable | N/A | As applicable | Based on NIS2/DORA/AI Act scope |
| **§9 Procurement** | Optional | Optional | Optional | N/A | Optional | Buyer-side obligation |

 

Note on OSS Steward column: "Optional" indicates the section is not typically required by CRA obligations for stewards but may be adopted voluntarily. "Recommended" indicates good practice. OSS Stewards must put in place and document, in a verifiable manner, a cybersecurity policy supporting secure development and vulnerability handling (CRA Art. 24(1)). Note: under Art. 24, stewards may also fall within scope of §3.5 importer/distributor obligations depending on their activities. For Section 4 (Vulnerability Handling), Art. 14(1) applies to stewards to the extent they are involved in development; Art. 14(3) and 14(8) apply where severe incidents affect network and information systems provided by the steward for development of the relevant FOSS.

**Important: All bracketed \[INSERT ...\] fields throughout this document must be completed with organization-specific information before any compliance claim or self-certification is made. Completion or signature of this checklist does not, by itself, establish CRA conformity. Conformity depends on completion of the applicable conformity-assessment procedure and the associated technical documentation, EU Declaration of Conformity, and CE-marking obligations.**

 

# **Section 2: Program Architecture & Governance**

This section establishes the organizational foundation for CRA compliance. Note: §2.1-2.4 apply to all roles including Stewards (as Recommended). §2.5-§2.7 are product-assessment controls for manufacturers; importers/distributors verify manufacturer evidence where applicable; they are N/A for OSS Stewards unless the steward also qualifies as the manufacturer for the relevant product or activity.

 

## **2.1 CRA Policy**

A documented cybersecurity policy for CRA compliance defines the organization commitment and obligations. Note: §2.1 is targeted primarily at Manufacturers. The policy obligations for OSS Stewards are lighter and governed by CRA Art. 24 and Annex II.

## **2.5 Product Risk Categorization & Conformity Assessment Route**

Before executing self-certification, the organization must determine the CRA product classification per CRA Art. 6, 24, and 32 and Annexes III-IV. Technical descriptions of product categories are specified in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392. Self-certification (Module A, per CRA Annex VIII Part 1\) is only lawful for Default products and certain Class I products using harmonized standards. Art. 32(5) allows qualifying Annex III FOSS products to use one of the procedures referred to in Art. 32(1), provided that Art. 31 technical documentation is publicly available at market placement; see item 2.5.9. Note: §2.5-§2.7 are N/A for OSS Stewards unless the steward also qualifies as the manufacturer for the relevant product or activity.

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.5.1** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The organization must document whether each in-scope product constitutes a product with digital elements (PDE) under CRA Art. 3(1), distinguishing it from standalone SaaS excluded under Recital 12\. Products whose primary function is remote data processing for a PDE are in CRA scope; standalone SaaS not providing such processing falls under NIS2, not CRA. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Scope determination memo referencing Recital 12 and Commission guidance C(2026) 5252; product-by-product classification table. |
| **2.5.2** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] Before selecting a conformity pathway, the organization must determine whether it has an EU establishment. If the manufacturer is not EU-established, the need for an EU-established responsible economic operator must be confirmed through product-specific legal analysis under applicable Union harmonisation legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 Article 4 where applicable. CRA Article 18 permits appointment of an EU authorised representative by written mandate but does not impose that appointment as a blanket requirement. Cross-reference §7.4. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | EU establishment confirmation or, where applicable, signed AR mandate, importer agreement, or fulfillment provider contract. |
| **2.5.3** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The organization must formally evaluate each in-scope product against CRA Annex III (Important Class I and II) and Annex IV (Critical) and record a product classification decision with supporting rationale. The technical descriptions of product categories are specified in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Classification register with product name, classification outcome, and decision date. Reference: CRA Annex III, Annex IV, and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392 (eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32025R2392). |
| **2.5.4** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For Default products, the organization may use self-certification (Internal Control \- Module A, per CRA Annex VIII Part 1\) provided the assessment basis is documented. Art. 32(5) provides an additional pathway for manufacturers of products qualifying as FOSS under the commercial-activity test; legal counsel should be consulted on applicability. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Self-assessment record referencing applicable harmonized standard or essential requirements mapped to design. Reference: CRA Annex VIII Part 1 for Module A procedure. |
| **2.5.5** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For Important Class I products, the organization must either: (a) apply a harmonized standard in full and use self-certification, or (b) engage a Notified Body. The decision must be documented and justified. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Notified Body engagement letter OR harmonized standard coverage analysis; classification rationale memo. |
| **2.5.6** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For Important Class II or Critical products, the organization must engage a Notified Body assessment or European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme and track it to completion before EU market placement. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Notified Body contract; assessment status; EU type-examination certificate where required. |
| **2.5.7** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] Product classification must be reviewed upon any substantial modification (as defined in CRA Art. 3(30)) or other relevant change that may affect conformity. Annual review may be retained as a good-practice governance cadence. A substantial modification may change the product classification and trigger a new conformity assessment obligation. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Classification review log; change-triggered review records. |
| **2.5.8** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should maintain a documented classification decision procedure to ensure consistent classification of new products and substantial modifications. While not explicitly required by CRA text, this procedure supports demonstrable compliance with the classification obligations in Art. 6 and Art. 32\. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Classification decision procedure; examples of classification decisions applied. |
| **2.5.9** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For manufacturers of products qualifying as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the commercial-activity test (§5.1.5), Art. 32(5) allows qualifying Annex III FOSS products to demonstrate conformity by using one of the procedures referred to in Art. 32(1), provided that the technical documentation referred to in Art. 31 is publicly available at market placement. The organization must determine whether this pathway applies and document the determination with legal rationale. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Legal determination memo on Art. 32(5) applicability; reference to Commission guidance C(2026) 5252 on commercial-activity test criteria. |

 

## **2.6 Cybersecurity Risk Assessment (CRA Art. 13(2)–(4))**

The cybersecurity risk assessment determines which CRA Annex I essential cybersecurity requirements apply and how those requirements are addressed. This section is distinct from §2.5: §2.5 determines the product's CRA classification and conformity-assessment route under CRA Art. 6, Art. 32, and Annexes III-IV, while §2.6 determines which requirements apply and how.

Art. 13(5) due diligence for third-party and FOSS components is addressed in §3 and §5. This section is not applicable to OSS Stewards unless the steward also qualifies as the manufacturer for the relevant product or activity.

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.6.1** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The manufacturer must perform and document a cybersecurity risk assessment for each product with digital elements. The assessment must document, as a minimum, the product's intended purpose, its reasonably foreseeable use, the conditions of use including the operational environment and the assets to be protected, and the expected time in use. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Assessment per product; register recording product, version and assessment date. CRA Art. 13(2) and 13(3) sentence 2. Support period per §6.1.1 and Art. 13(8). |
| **2.6.2** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The assessment must record, for each essential requirement in Annex I Part I(2)(a)–(m), whether it is applicable to the product and, where applicable, in what manner it applies and how it is implemented. Where a requirement is determined not to be applicable, the assessment must record a clear justification. The implementing controls themselves are recorded in §3.4 and §6.1. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Applicability determination covering all thirteen requirements, with justifications. CRA Art. 13(3) sentence 3 and Art. 13(4) sentence 3. |
| **2.6.3** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The assessment must record how the organization applies the requirements in Annex I Part I(1) and the vulnerability handling requirements in Annex I Part II. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Assessment addressing Annex I Part I(1) and each of Part II(1)–(8). CRA Art. 13(3) sentence 4; Commission guidance C(2026) 5252, points 164–166. |
| **2.6.4** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The assessment must show that the residual risks are sufficiently addressed through the implementation of the essential requirements, given the product's intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use, and must record acceptance with a named accountable role and a re-assessment date. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Residual risk statement per risk; acceptance record naming the accountable role and the re-assessment date. CRA Art. 13(2)–(3) with Annex I Part I(1); Commission guidance C(2026) 5252, point 159. |
| **2.6.5** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The outcome of the assessment must be taken into account during the planning, design, development, production, delivery and maintenance of the product. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Design and architecture records, or tests, citing assessment outcomes; release security gate sign-off (§3.4.10); support-period decision record (§6.1). CRA Art. 13(2). |
| **2.6.6** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The assessment must be included in the technical documentation for the product. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Technical file index entry; see §7.1.1. CRA Art. 13(4) sentence 1; Art. 31; Annex VII. |
| **2.6.7** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The assessment must be kept up to date throughout the support period. Where a change to the product, to its conditions of use or operational environment, or to the threat landscape may affect the assessment, the organization must determine whether it is affected and update it where necessary. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Assessment version history showing each update and what triggered it. CRA Art. 13(3) sentence 1; support period per §6.1.1 and Art. 13(8). It is advisable to set a recurring check date to ensure updated assessments, and to record in version history any decision not to update the assessment. |
| **2.6.8** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The methodology used to identify, analyse and evaluate risk, and the basis on which sufficiency is judged, should be stated before risks are evaluated, justified for the product and its context, and applied consistently across products. The basis should account for the applicable regulatory requirements rather than for internal tolerance alone. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Documented risk assessment methodology; stated basis for judging sufficiency; a completed assessment showing both applied. Commission guidance C(2026) 5252, points 157–163 (not binding). |
| **2.6.9** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Identified risks should be recorded individually. Each entry should identify the threat, an estimate of the likelihood and impact of the resulting incident, the assessed risk level, the controls applied, and the residual level. A threat could be described by the asset it targets, the cybersecurity property that would be compromised, its cause, and the scenario in which the incident would arise. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Risk register with a stated scale for likelihood, impact and risk level; threat descriptions supporting each entry. |
| **2.6.10** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Controls should be recorded as distinct items, each mapped to the risks it reduces, with the treatment decision and its rationale documented.

| **2.6.11** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Where the mitigation of a risk depends on user action or on the product being used in a specific operational environment, that dependency should be stated in the conditions of use and communicated to users, and the risk should be treated as accepted only on that basis. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Conditions of use; the corresponding user-facing statement. Commission guidance C(2026) 5252, points 161–162. |
| **2.6.12** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Each control identified by the assessment should name the role accountable for the control being in operation, and the method by which its operation is verified. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Control register with owner and verification columns. |

## **2.7 Harmonized Standards Tracking**

CRA conformity depends on harmonized standards under Standardisation Request M/606, developed by ETSI, CEN, and CENELEC. As of August 2026, PT1 and PT3 drafts have been updated significantly since their public inquiry versions; final versions are not yet publicly available but are expected imminently. PT1 public inquiry draft and PT3 public inquiry draft are accessible via the NBN portal. ISO 27001 and IEC 62443 do not automatically create a presumption of CRA Annex I conformity, though they may be used as supporting evidence per EC FAQ 6.1 and Annex VIII Part 1\. Commission guidance final published version: C(2026) 5252, published 27 Jul 2026\.

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.7.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should identify which harmonized standards under Standardisation Request M/606 are relevant to its product categories and actively monitor their publication status via ETSI, CEN, and CENELEC. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Standards tracking register; assigned owner. PT1 public inquiry draft: app.nbn.be (search CEN PT1 CRA); PT3 public inquiry draft: app.nbn.be (search CEN PT3 CRA). Note: both drafts have been significantly updated since public inquiry; final versions are not yet publicly available. Monitor via CEN/CENELEC portal. |
| **2.7.2** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] Where harmonized standards relevant to the product are not yet available, the organization must document the gap and record whether a Notified Body has been engaged (required for Class I products absent harmonized standards). | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Conformity pathway decision log; Notified Body engagement record or written rationale. |
| **2.7.3** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should be aware that ISO 27001, IEC 62443, and similar general security standards do not automatically create a presumption of CRA Annex I conformity. CRA conformity must be assessed against Annex I requirements directly. However, per EC FAQ chapter 6.1 and Annex VIII, existing certifications under such standards may be used as supporting evidence within a broader conformity assessment, provided all Annex I essential requirements are explicitly addressed. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Written acknowledgement in conformity documentation. |
| **2.7.4** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] A trigger should exist to update the conformity pathway and re-run self-certification when a relevant M/606 harmonized standard is published. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Standards publication monitoring procedure; update trigger defined in program governance. |

 

 

# **Section 3: Component Management & SBOM Quality**

This section governs the quality and integrity of SBOMs. CRA Article 13 requires manufacturers to document components with sufficient granularity to identify known vulnerabilities. OpenChain ISO/IEC 18974 requires a documented process for component identification and vulnerability tracking.

 

## **3.1 Software Identification & Bill of Materials**

Processes for generating machine-readable SBOMs for all released products. CRA requires SBOMs covering at the very least the top-level dependencies of those products.

Reference: BSI TR-03183. |
| **3.1.2** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] SBOMs must be produced in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as a currently supported version of SPDX or CycloneDX, and must comply with any applicable implementing acts, harmonized standards, or common specifications. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Sample SBOM file; format validation report. Reference: BSI TR-03183-2 for SBOM content requirements. |
| **3.1.3** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] SBOM generation should be integrated into the software delivery pipeline and produce an artifact on every release build. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Software delivery pipeline configuration excerpt; build artifact manifest. |
| **3.1.4** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] SBOMs must cover, at a minimum, the top-level dependencies of the product in a commonly used and machine-readable format. \[GOOD PRACTICE\] SBOMs may also include transitive and embedded dependencies where technically feasible or necessary to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities affecting the product. Any components or dependency levels not covered should be documented together with a risk-based justification and the alternative measures used to ensure effective vulnerability management. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Tooling depth configuration; documented exclusions with risk-based justification; sample SBOM component count vs. dependency graph audit. |
| **3.1.5** | ⚠ DEADLINE: 11 Sep 2026 \- ⚠  \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should document a target SBOM depth decision with operational rationale tied to the ability to determine within 24 hours whether an actively exploited CVE affects any shipped product.

A top-level-only SBOM may be insufficient for transitive-dependency scenarios. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | SBOM depth policy; operational rationale linking depth to 24-hour window; evidence of automated CVE-to-SBOM matching test; documented monitoring method for unresolved dependency levels. |
| **3.1.6** | \[DIRECT CRA OBLIGATION\] SBOMs must be drawn up in a commonly used, machine-readable format and must cover at least the top-level dependencies of the product. \[ORGANIZATION SBOM PROFILE / IMPLEMENTATION CONTROL\] The organization SBOM profile should include product-level metadata (product name, version, supplier, release date, unique product identifier) and component-level metadata (component name, version, supplier, unique component identifier such as PURL, CPE, or SWHID (ISO/IEC 18670), cryptographic hash, and license information including declared and concluded license) for each component. These additional fields support implementation, traceability, CISA Minimum Elements alignment, ISO/IEC 18974 alignment, and ISO/IEC 5230 compliance evidence, but are not presented as the CRA statutory minimum. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | SBOM field mapping to CRA Annex I (primary requirement), CISA 2025 Minimum Elements for SBOM (informational reference replacing the 2021 NTIA minimum elements), and BSI TR-03183-2 (implementation guidance for German market). Where these references differ, CRA Annex I takes precedence. SWHID reference: https://swhid.org. Reference: https://www.[bsi.bund.de](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Technische-Richtlinien/TR-nach-Thema-sortiert/tr03183/TR-03183_node.html)/TR03183 |
| **3.1.7** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] For products containing physical hardware components, a Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM) should be maintained alongside the SBOM to identify hardware components and their firmware dependencies. For machine-readable HBOM exchange, CycloneDX (ECMA-424 / CycloneDX 1.7 or later) is the recommended format; SPDX 3.x hardware profile may be used where producer and consumer tooling support it. Software-only organizations may mark this item N/A with documented rationale. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Machine-readable HBOM (CycloneDX/ECMA-424 preferred; SPDX 3.x hardware profile where supported); hardware component inventory; firmware version register. |

| **3.2.3** | \[CONFORMITY EVIDENCE / IMPLEMENTATION CONTROL\] Minimum required SBOM fields per CRA Annex I should be validated, and BSI TR-03183-2 field validation may be used as an implementation reference before SBOM sign-off. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Validation rule set; example of a rejected SBOM and remediation. |
| **3.2.4** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Quality metrics for SBOMs (e.g., completeness score, field population rate) should be tracked and reviewed periodically. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Dashboard screenshot or metrics report. |
| **3.2.5** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] File-level or snippet-level SBOM references should be avoided where a complete software package can be identified. If file-level or snippet-level references are used, the SBOM should clearly label the granularity, map the reference to the smallest complete software package where possible, and state whether the dependency chain terminates at that point when further dependency tracking is not feasible. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | SBOM sample; package mapping rationale; snippet/file-level exception record; dependency-chain termination note. |

# **Section 8: Cross-Framework Integration**

The CRA sits within a broader EU digital regulatory stack. This section ensures the organization identifies where CRA conformity artifacts serve multiple regulatory obligations simultaneously.

 

## **8.1 CRA and NIS2**

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **8.1.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should determine whether it is subject to NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) as an essential or important entity independently of its CRA manufacturer obligations. Where both apply, a mapping should exist showing how CRA product security artifacts satisfy NIS2 supply chain security assessment requirements (NIS2 Art. 21(2)(d)). | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Dual-framework mapping document; NIS2 supply chain security procedure referencing CRA conformity artifacts. |
| **8.1.2** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] For organizations subject to both NIS2 and CRA, governance, risk assessment, and incident response processes should be designed to serve both frameworks on shared rather than parallel tracks where the underlying obligation is equivalent. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Integrated GRC framework document; evidence that NIS2 incident reporting and CRA Art. 14 notification runbooks share escalation paths and RACI roles. |

 

## **8.2 CRA and AI Act**

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **8.2.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] For any product that is both a PDE under CRA and a high-risk AI system under the AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689), the organization should document that CRA Annex I compliance satisfies the AI Act Art. 15 cybersecurity requirements for that product, per CRA Art. 12\. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | AI Act / CRA dual-scope determination per product; mapping from CRA Annex I to AI Act Art. 15\. |
| **8.2.2** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] For Important or Critical CRA products that are also high-risk AI systems, the organization should document that CRA conformity assessment requirements take precedence over AI Act internal control provisions for cybersecurity aspects (per CRA Art. 12). This precedence should be recorded in the product conformity assessment plan. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Precedence determination in conformity assessment plan; legal review sign-off. |

 

## **8.3 CRA and DORA**

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **8.4.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] For connected products that simultaneously qualify under the Data Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854), overlapping obligations around data access, documentation, and user transparency should be identified, and the compliance program should address both regulations in a coordinated manner. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Data Act / CRA product scope overlap assessment; coordinated documentation plan. |

 

## **8.5 CRA and eIDAS**

eIDAS 2.0 (Regulation (EU) 2024/1183) governs electronic identification and trust services. Where CRA products interact with eIDAS-governed identity services or where an Authorized Representative operates under eIDAS-regulated digital identity, the interaction between the two frameworks should be assessed.

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **8.5.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] For products that interact with eIDAS-governed electronic identification or trust services, the organization should assess whether eIDAS 2.0 (Regulation (EU) 2024/1183) creates obligations in addition to CRA, particularly where the product functions as a relying party or issues electronic attestations. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Legal determination memo; eIDAS / CRA dual-scope assessment; reference to Regulation (EU) 2024/1183. |
| **8.5.2** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Where the organization appoints an EU Authorized Representative and that AR operates using eIDAS-regulated digital identity services, the organization should document how the eIDAS and CRA AR obligations interact and should seek legal counsel given the evolving hybridization of these frameworks. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Legal counsel assessment; AR mandate review against eIDAS identity obligations; reference to CRA Art. 18 and eIDAS 2.0 Art. 45\. |

 

 

# **Section 9: Procurement & Buyer-Side Obligations**

The CRA changes what responsible procurement looks like. For organizations subject to NIS2, these questions are simultaneously regulatory requirements.

 

## **9.1 Vendor CRA Qualification**

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **9.1.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The vendor evaluation process should require suppliers of products with digital elements to confirm: (a) the CRA product classification; (b) the conformity pathway used; (c) the declared support period end date. Note: The notified body used is published on the EU DoC and need not be separately collected. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Updated vendor questionnaire or RFP template; example completed vendor response. |
| **9.1.2** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Procurement contracts for products with digital elements should include at minimum: (a) CRA conformity confirmation; (b) commitment to maintain vulnerability handling for the declared support period; (c) notification obligation to the buyer upon discovery of an actively exploited vulnerability in a supplied product. Note: Contractual access to Technical File or DoC is a good practice and not a CRA statutory obligation. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Updated standard contract template with CRA clauses; legal review sign-off. |
| **9.1.3** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should ask suppliers whether they produce SBOMs for procured products, in what format, and whether they are available.
