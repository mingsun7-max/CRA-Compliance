# **Section 1: Introduction & Scope**

This document defines the organization compliance program for the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), structured in alignment with the OpenChain Project adoption framework and ISO/IEC 18974 (Open Source Security Assurance). It serves as both a policy framework and a self-certification checklist.

The CRA (Regulation (EU) 2024/2847) establishes mandatory cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements (PDEs) placed on the EU market. The following role definitions are drawn from CRA Art. 3:

 

**Role definitions (CRA Art. 3):**

●  Manufacturer (Art. 3(13)): a natural or legal person who develops or manufactures a PDE, or has a PDE designed or manufactured, and markets it under their name or trademark, whether for payment, free of charge, or as a monetary revenue-generating service.

●  Importer (Art. 3(17)): a natural or legal person established in the Union who places on the market a PDE bearing the name or trademark of a natural or legal person established outside the Union.

●  Distributor (Art. 3(18)): a natural or legal person in the supply chain, other than the manufacturer or importer, that makes a PDE available on the Union market.

●  OSS Steward (Art. 3(14)): a legal person, other than a manufacturer, who provides support on a sustained basis for the development of products qualifying as FOSS and ensures the viability of those products. The definition, scope, and obligations of OSS Stewards are established in CRA Art. 3(14), Recitals 18 and 19, and Art. 24\.

 

**Scope of this document:**

●  All software products with digital elements placed on the EU market by \[INSERT: Full legal entity name of manufacturer\]

●  Open-source components included in released products

●  Software supply chain processes including SBOM generation, vulnerability management, and disclosure

●  Personnel and processes involved in development, security operations, legal, and compliance

 

Hardware scope note: Hardware-specific requirements (including §3.1.7 Hardware Bill of Materials) apply only to products containing physical hardware components. Software-only organizations may mark hardware-specific items N/A with documented rationale.

 

**Applicability by Organizational Role**

The CRA creates distinct obligations for different organizational roles. Determine which role(s) apply before completing this checklist. A single organization may occupy multiple roles simultaneously. Complete all sections that apply to each role held.

 

| Section | Manufacturer | Importer | Distributor | OSS Steward | Both Mfr+Steward | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **§2.1-2.4 Governance** | Required | Required | Required | Recommended | Required | All roles need basic governance |
| **§2.5-2.6 Categorization** | Required | Required | Required | N/A | Required | Stewards are not manufacturers; conformity assessment does not apply |
| **§3.1-3.4 SBOM & SDLC** | Required | N/A | N/A | N/A | Required | Manufacturer builds the product |
| **§3.5 Importer/Distributor** | N/A | Required | Required | See note\* | N/A | \*Art. 24 may bring stewards into scope depending on activities |
| **§4 Vuln Handling** | Required | Partial (§4.4 only) | Partial (§4.4 only) | Partial (see note\*\*) | Required | \*\*Art. 14(1) applies where steward is involved in development; Art. 14(3) and 14(8) apply where severe incidents affect network/information systems provided by the steward |
| **§5 OSS Stewardship** | Optional | Optional | Optional | Required | Required | Core for steward role |
| **§6 Support Period** | Required | N/A | N/A | N/A | Required | Manufacturer sets support period |
| **§7.1-7.4 Technical File** | Required | Verify only | Verify only | N/A | Required | Importers check, not produce |
| **§8 Cross-Framework** | As applicable | As applicable | As applicable | N/A | As applicable | Based on NIS2/DORA/AI Act scope |
| **§9 Procurement** | Optional | Optional | Optional | N/A | Optional | Buyer-side obligation |

 

Note on OSS Steward column: "Optional" indicates the section is not typically required by CRA obligations for stewards but may be adopted voluntarily. "Recommended" indicates good practice. OSS Stewards must maintain a security policy and vulnerability handling process (CRA Art. 24 and Annex II). Note: under Art. 24, stewards may also fall within scope of §3.5 importer/distributor obligations depending on their activities. For Section 4 (Vulnerability Handling), Art. 14(1) applies to stewards to the extent they are involved in development; Art. 14(3) and 14(8) apply where severe incidents affect network and information systems provided by the steward for development of the relevant FOSS.

# **Section 2: Program Architecture & Governance**

This section establishes the organizational foundation for CRA compliance. Note: §2.1-2.4 apply to all roles including Stewards (as Recommended). §2.5 and §2.6 apply only to Manufacturers and Importers/Distributors; they are N/A for OSS Stewards.

 

## **2.1 CRA Policy**

A documented cybersecurity policy for CRA compliance defines the organization commitment and obligations. Note: §2.1 is targeted primarily at Manufacturers. The policy obligations for OSS Stewards are lighter and governed by CRA Art. 24 and Annex II.

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| **2.4.8** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] Expired exceptions should be reviewed and either resolved, renewed with updated justification, or escalated. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Exception renewal procedure; escalation log. |

 

## **2.5 Product Risk Categorization & Conformity Assessment Route**

Before executing self-certification, the organization must determine the CRA product classification per CRA Art. 6, 24, and 32 and Annexes III-IV. Technical descriptions of product categories are specified in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392. Self-certification (Module A, per CRA Annex VIII Part 1\) is only lawful for Default products and certain Class I products using harmonized standards. Art. 32(5) provides an additional pathway for FOSS manufacturers; see item 2.5.9. Note: §2.5 and §2.6 are N/A for OSS Stewards.

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.5.1** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The organization must document whether each in-scope product constitutes a product with digital elements (PDE) under CRA Art. 3(1), distinguishing it from standalone SaaS excluded under Recital 12\. Products whose primary function is remote data processing for a PDE are in CRA scope; standalone SaaS not providing such processing falls under NIS2, not CRA. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Scope determination memo referencing Recital 12 and Commission guidance C(2026) 5252; product-by-product classification table. |
| **2.5.2** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] Before selecting a conformity pathway, the organization must determine whether it has an EU establishment. If not EU-established, one of the following must be in place before market placement: (a) an EU Authorized Representative, (b) an EU-based importer, or (c) an EU-based fulfillment service provider. Cross-reference §7.4. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | EU establishment confirmation or, where applicable, signed AR mandate, importer agreement, or fulfillment provider contract. |
| **2.5.3** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] The organization must formally evaluate each in-scope product against CRA Annex III (Important Class I and II) and Annex IV (Critical) and record a product classification decision with supporting rationale. The technical descriptions of product categories are specified in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Classification register with product name, classification outcome, and decision date. Reference: CRA Annex III, Annex IV, and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/2392 (eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32025R2392). |
| **2.5.4** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For Default products, the organization may use self-certification (Internal Control \- Module A, per CRA Annex VIII Part 1\) provided the assessment basis is documented. Art. 32(5) provides an additional pathway for manufacturers of products qualifying as FOSS under the commercial-activity test; legal counsel should be consulted on applicability. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Self-assessment record referencing applicable harmonized standard or essential requirements mapped to design. Reference: CRA Annex VIII Part 1 for Module A procedure. |
| **2.5.5** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For Important Class I products, the organization must either: (a) apply a harmonized standard in full and use self-certification, or (b) engage a Notified Body. The decision must be documented and justified. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Notified Body engagement letter OR harmonized standard coverage analysis; classification rationale memo. |
| **2.5.6** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For Important Class II or Critical products, the organization must engage a Notified Body assessment or European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme and track it to completion before EU market placement. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Notified Body contract; assessment status; EU type-examination certificate where required. |
| **2.5.7** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] Product classification must be reviewed upon any substantial modification (as defined in CRA Art. 3(32)) and at minimum annually. A substantial modification may change the product classification and trigger a new conformity assessment obligation. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Classification review log; change-triggered review records. |
| **2.5.8** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should maintain a documented classification decision procedure to ensure consistent classification of new products and substantial modifications. While not explicitly required by CRA text, this procedure supports demonstrable compliance with the classification obligations in Art. 6 and Art. 32\. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Classification decision procedure; examples of classification decisions applied. |
| **2.5.9** | \[CRA REQUIREMENT\] For manufacturers of products qualifying as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the commercial-activity test (§5.1.5), Art. 32(5) provides a specific conformity pathway. The organization must determine whether this pathway applies and document the determination with legal rationale. Where it applies, the organization must fulfill the applicable obligations under Art. 32(5) in lieu of the standard Module A or Notified Body routes. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Legal determination memo on Art. 32(5) applicability; reference to Commission guidance C(2026) 5252 on commercial-activity test criteria. |

 

## **2.6 Harmonized Standards Tracking**

CRA conformity depends on harmonized standards under Standardisation Request M/606, developed by ETSI, CEN, and CENELEC. As of August 2026, PT1 and PT3 drafts have been updated significantly since their public inquiry versions; final versions are not yet publicly available but are expected imminently. PT1 public inquiry draft and PT3 public inquiry draft are accessible via the NBN portal. ISO 27001 and IEC 62443 do not automatically create a presumption of CRA Annex I conformity, though they may be used as supporting evidence per EC FAQ 6.1 and Annex VIII Part 1\. Commission guidance final published version: C(2026) 5252, published July 27, 2026\.

 

| Ref | Requirement | Conformant? (Yes / No / Partial) | Evidence & Rationale | Guidance / Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.6.1** | \[GOOD PRACTICE\] The organization should identify which harmonized standards under Standardisation Request M/606 are relevant to its product categories and actively monitor their publication status via ETSI, CEN, and CENELEC. | ☐ Yes   ☐ No   ☐ Partial |   | Standards tracking register; assigned owner.
